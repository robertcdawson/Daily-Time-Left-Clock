# Tech Stack

## Front-End Framework:
- Vue.js: A lightweight, progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces with reactivity and component-based architecture.

## Markup and Styling:
- HTML5: For semantic structure.
- CSS3: For styling, including responsive design, animations, and smooth background transitions.
- Optional: CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS if you need advanced styling features.

## Scripting and Data Handling:
- JavaScript (ES6+): For business logic, time calculations, and DOM manipulation.
- SVG: For drawing the large circle and animating the sun icon, ensuring scalability and crisp graphics across devices.

## Development and Build Tools:
- Vue CLI or Vite: For scaffolding the Vue.js project, handling hot-reload, and bundling assets.
- NPM: As the package manager for dependencies.

## Optional Libraries:
- date-fns or Day.js: For robust date/time calculations (though native JavaScript Date functions might suffice for simple arithmetic).

## Local Hosting:
- A simple static file server (e.g., using the serve package or the VS Code Live Server extension) for local testing and development.
